##TODO: Things I'd like to finish out in the future
- finish out the tests
- modularize by creating utility/helper functions in the assets/js folder
- I heart love sql-- would've liked to have made proper calls and requests for friends and recent updates.. by organizing sql schemas of multiple users and their relationships. (I did something similar in React for Habitude, https://github.com/veeweeherman/habitude ...made a user's profile with React and Postgresl)

##Had lots of helpful tips from:

- http://www.bradoncode.com/blog/2015/05/19/karma-angularjs-testing/
